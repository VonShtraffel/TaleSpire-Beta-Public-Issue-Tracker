Hi, I have this problem where i can't go back into my friend's campaign. It either get me in the Board loading segment but it can't load the board
or it says the game failed to correclty assign a player an important internal ID and that rather than risking screwing the board feel free to join back.
I'm now in a loop between those 2.
